# LifeLetter

## Description
There are a lot of services that take care of the legal aspects of the end of a person's life, but many people don't consider the importance of reflecting on their lives and expressing their feelings to those they love.

Inspired by <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/letter/friendsandfamily.html">The Stanford Letter Project</a>, I've created an easy way to write and send messages to those you love which will be distributed in the event you pass away, so nothing important gets left unsaid.

Back end repo <a href="https://github.com/matt-green1/capstone_backend">here</a>.

## Demo
You can watch video demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYok3fufeUI&feature=youtu.be&ab_channel=MatthewGreen">here</a>. Live site coming soon.
