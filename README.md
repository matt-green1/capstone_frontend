# LifeLetter

A will for your feelings.

## Description
There are a lot of services that take care of the legal aspects of the end of a person's life, but many people don't consider the importance of reflecting on their lives and expressing their feelings to those they love.

Inspired by <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/letter/friendsandfamily.html">The Stanford Letter Project</a>, I've created an easy way to write and send messages to those you love which will be distributed in the event you pass away, so nothing important gets left unsaid.

***Video demo and live site coming soon.
